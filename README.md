## Description

This is a web application that allows you to play the classic game of Hangman. The game is terminal-based and has been written in Python. The objective of the game is to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of tries.

To play the game, simply start the application and follow the prompts in the terminal. You can choose between different difficulty levels, which will determine the length and complexity of the word you have to guess.

Enjoy the game and good luck!

## User Stories

1. As a player, I want to be able to choose the difficulty level (easy/hard) before starting the game, so I can tailor the challenge to my skill level.

2. As a player, I want to receive visual feedback on the current state of the hangman after each incorrect guess, so I can keep track of my progress.

3. As a player, I want to see the word representation with underscores for unguessed letters, so I can see how many letters are in the word.

4. As a player, I want to be able to make guesses by entering a single letter or an entire word, so I have flexibility in how I approach the game.

5. As a player, I want to be notified if I've already guessed a letter, so I don't waste a guess on a letter I've already tried.

6. As a player, I want to see a list of my previous guesses, so I can keep track of which letters and words I've already attempted.

7. As a player, I want to be informed if I've won or lost the game, along with the correct word if I lose, so I know the outcome of the game.

8. As a player, I want the option to play the game again after a game is finished, so I can continue playing without having to restart the program.
